## Folders

* `hello-haskell` - simple project structure with stack and two simple modules.
    The project is a demo project for `stack` and demonstrates the use of
    testing frameworks: `HUnit`, `QuickCheck`, `doctest` and finally
    the (Behaviour Driven Development) BDD-inspired testing framework `Hspec`.
* `hello-chuck` - simple demo for JSON parsing and http GET request
   * `hello-chuck-haskell` - implementation of Chuck jokes in Haskell
   * `hello-chuck-go` - Go
   * `hello-chuck-rust` - Rust
* `lecture-three` - simple arithmethic calculator, code for [the online lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FehRZbQW8Eg)
* `students` - applicative error validation, error bubbling up and error consolidation
   * `language` - check the corresponding language subfolder for an implementation in that language
   * `generator-rust` - data generator for testing students implementations
* `zmq-demo` - simple Publish-Subscribe skeleton app using zmq in Haskell
* `zmq-go` - same as `zmq-demo`, but this time in Go
* `rust` - All rust examples and code from lectures
   * `ownership` - code for the [ownership lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcCijWFIgaU)
